  <b>Thinking Like a Programmer</b><br>
  <div class="steps">
    1. Procedural Thinking - taking a big problem and breaking the solution down<br>
    in a series of steps.<br>
    2. Abstract Thinking - finding similarity amongst seemingly different things.<br>
    3. Systematic Debugging - identifying problems and tracking down<br>
    potential causes.<br>
    4. Technological Empathy - understanding how the computer sees things.<br>
    5. Systems Thinking - taking a big idea and breaking it down into<br>
    component pieces.<br><br>

  <b>Debugging</b><br>
  <div class="Steps">
    Relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program<br>
    that doesn't work.<br>
    - Collect evidence. (what makes this program fail)<br>
    - Generate theories. (what may have caused this problem?)<br>
    - Test those theories. (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)<br>
    - Fix the problem.<br><br>
